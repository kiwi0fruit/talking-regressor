# talking-regressor

Brainstorm-like repo for applying language models like GPT to Auto-ML models that perform regression (automatic talking and answering questions on compressed and factorized latent representation).

I think it would be nice and convenient to have a tool that can take some statistical data from you, then it makes a regression that gets a probalistic model with disentangled latent representation (via Beta-TCVAE, simply Factor Analysis or even GAN - but I'm not aware of the state of Auto-ML for GANs). Then it applies language model like GPT to it. First it asks you some questions on obtained disentangled representation. Then it would be able to write an automatic report on the nature of the probabilistic model and even answer questions on it.

At the moment my expertise in this area is limited to models implemented in the [jats-semi-supervised-pytorch](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/jats-semi-supervised-pytorch) project. I haven't even done a research on "talking regressor" topic yet. I guess some progress in this direction is being made right now by machine learning community as it's a cool and useful direction.

This repo promotes of an idea to create such a "talking regressor" but at the same it's a declaration of my intentions to have this as a hobby at least. Hence I'm interested in having competence in both language models and regressions with disentangled representations.
