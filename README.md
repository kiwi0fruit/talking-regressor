# talking-regressor

Brainstorm-like repo for applying language models like GPT to Auto-ML models that perform regression (automatic talking and answering questions on compressed and factorized latent representation).

I think it would be nice and convenient to have a tool that can take some statistical data from you, then it makes a regression that gets a probalistic model with disentangled latent representation. Then it applies language model like GPT to it. First it asks you some questions on obtained disentangled representation. Then it would be able to write an automatic report on the nature of the probabilistic model and even answer questions on it.
